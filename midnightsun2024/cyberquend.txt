HFS has never made an OSINT challenge, but for this, we will make an exception.
Sophia "quend" d'Antoine is legendary in the industry, community, sub-culture and
in this game of CTF.
Her reach and influence go back to the very first wargame and CTF communities on the
internet and all the way to the high end of the industry.

She was beloved. She is beloved.

On her way, she always respected the lore and legend of those who came before her, and
those who would follow after.

So for those of you who are not aware, it is time to learn some about her legend,
we will keep it light because there is too much to cover.

separated by an underscore. If the answer seems like it may be 2 or more words,
then pick the first word or join them into a single word.
